```

```
SECRET_KEY
```

Provide a database url string. If you want to use `mysql`, then you should either have the credentials ready or use `docker-compose.yml` file to add the db. If you dont wnat to create additional setup, then you can use `sqlite`.
```sh
DATABASE_URL

# eg.
# DATABASE_URL="file:data/letterpad.sqlite"
# DATABASE_URL="mysql://user:pwd@172.17.0.1:3306/db_name?connect_timeout=5" 
```
