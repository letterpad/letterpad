          by users of the Service (“Creators”) with a monetary payment conducted
          via integration with a third-party payment platform, such as Stripe or
          PayPal. Sponsorships are not endorsements by the Service nor by
          Letterpad about the Creator or the underlying article(s). Any disputes
          related to the Sponsorship, including monetary issues are between the
          Sponsor and the Creator, and/or the applicable third-party payment
          platform, are between those applicable parties only, and not
          Letterpad. The Service and Letterpad does not review the
          identification or origination of any Sponsor or Creator.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Service may charge convenience fees to process Sponsorships and
          any such fees shall be set forth separately and acknowledged by such
          applicable Creator. Letterpad does not handle any applicable tax
          payments or filings for the Creators and Creators acknowledge they
          must file all appropriate tax forms and make all applicable tax
          payments for received Sponsorships.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sponsorships are non-refundable. Letterpad is under no obligations to
          commence or continue any Sponsorship program on the Service.

        <h2>17. Repeat Infringer Policy.</h2>
        <p>
          In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable laws around the
          world, Letterpad has adopted a policy that it will promptly terminate
          without notice any user's access to the Service if that user is
          determined by Letterpad to be a "repeat infringer." A repeat infringer
          includes, without limitation a user who has been notified by Letterpad
          of infringing activity violations more than twice and/or who has had
          any user-submitted content removed from the Service more than twice.
          Letterpad may also at our sole discretion limit access to the Service
          and/or terminate the access of any users who infringe any intellectual
          property rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat
          infringement.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, Letterpad accommodates and does not interfere with
          standard technical measures used by intellectual property rights
          owners to protect their materials.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that we do not offer refunds to Users whose access is
          terminated as a result of repeated infringement of these Terms of Use.
        </p>
        <h2>18. Limitation of Liability.</h2>
        <p>
          In no event shall Letterpad be liable for any damages whatsoever,
          whether direct, indirect, general, special, compensatory,
          consequential, and/or incidental, arising out of or relating to the
          Websites or Service, or use thereof. Nothing contained in the Websites
          or Service or in any written or oral communications from Letterpad or

          INCLUDING DIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR

          INDEMNITY OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH SUCH LIABILITY IS BASED.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the event that any of the foregoing limitations are deemed to be
          unenforceable, to the greatest extent permitted by law, you agree that
          the entire aggregate liability of Letterpad and sole remedy available
          to any User in any case in any way arising out of or relating to the
          Agreement, Websites or the Service shall be limited to monetary
          damages that in the aggregate may not exceed the greater of $100.00 or
          the sum of any amount paid by the User to Letterpad during the six
          months prior to notice to Letterpad of the dispute for which the
          remedy is sought.

          any third party claim of infringement of copyright or other
          intellectual property rights or invasion of privacy arising from the
          hosting of Your Content on the Websites, and/or your making available
          thereof to other users of the Websites, and/or the actual use of Your
          Content by other users of the Websites or related services in

          any activity related to your use of the Websites, be it by you or by

          unless such activity was caused by the act or default of Letterpad.
        </p>
        <h2>20. Attorney Fees.</h2>

          PRESENT. INDIVIDUALS UNDER THE AGE OF 13 ARE NOT PERMITTED TO

        </p>
        <h2>23. Jurisdiction and Choice of Law; Dispute Resolution.</h2>
        <p>
          If there is any dispute arising out of the Websites and/or the
          Service, by using the Websites and/or Service, you expressly agree
          that any such dispute shall be governed by the laws of the State of
          Delaware, without regard to its conflict of law provisions, and you
          expressly agree and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of
          the state and federal courts of the State of Delaware, for the
          resolution of any such dispute. Acceptance of the terms and conditions
          of this Agreement constitutes your consent to be sued in such courts
          and to accept service of process outside the State of Delaware with
          the same force and effect as if such service had been made within the
          State of Delaware. You hereby agree to accept service of process for
          any action hereunder by certified mail return receipt requested which
          service shall have the same force and effect as though service had
          been effected by personal service in the applicable jurisdiction. Any
          dispute must be filed within one year after the relevant claim arose;
          otherwise, the dispute is permanently barred, which means that you and
          Letterpad will not have the right to assert the claim. If any part of
          these terms is unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that part will be
          deemed severable and will not affect the validity and enforceability
          of the remaining provisions.
        </p>
        <h2>24. Arbitration Provision/No Class Action.</h2>
        <p>
          Except where prohibited by law, as a condition of using the Websites
          and/or Service, you agree that any and all disputes, claims and causes
          of action (collectively, "Claim") arising out of or connected with the
          Websites and/or Service, shall be resolved individually, without
          resort to any form of class action, exclusively by binding arbitration
          for full and final settlement of such Claim, and judgment on the award
          rendered in the arbitration may be entered in any court having
          jurisdiction thereof. The parties shall split the arbitration and/or
          mediator costs. An award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered
          and confirmed by the courts of the State of Delaware, County of
          Sussex, or the United States District Court for the District of
          Delaware. The parties agree that any post-arbitration action seeking
          to enforce an arbitration award or action seeking equitable or
          injunctive relief shall be brought exclusively in the courts of the
          State of Delaware, County of Sussex, or the United States District
          Court for the District of Delaware.
