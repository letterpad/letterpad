        It might be counterintuitive, but it’s true: free content is crucial to
        successful paid newsletters. Many publishers we speak to believe it’s
        important to save their best work for their paying subscribers. In
        general, that’s a big mistake. The most successful publications make
        much of their best and most accessible content free. You might think
        that people subscribe to publications to get stuff, like articles,
        episodes, or reports. But mostly people subscribe for a sense of
        relationship with the publisher. In such cases, they’re paying for the
        publisher’s worldview. They want the ability to tap into the publisher’s
        brain; to see things through their eyes. If you’re a publisher of a paid
        newsletter, then, your goal should be to give as many people as possible
        the chance to fall in love with your voice and worldview. Those who do
        come to love your work will happily pay to get more of that good thing
        in their lives. High-quality free content is key to all of this.

          The best possible marketing

        Even though every fibre of your being may tell you that your best work
        should go behind the paywall, it’s smart to make your most thoughtful
        and accessible content free to everyone. That way, it stands a chance of
        being shared and widely read. It’s important to note that this is not
        the same as clickbait. It’s about making sure that your best work gets
        the attention it deserves, and then using that gravity to pull people
        deeper into your orbit. (If you just trick people into clicking when the
        work is no good, they won’t subscribe.) Free content is the best
        possible advertisement for your publication, since it demonstrates your
        unique perspective and abilities. It gives people a chance to fall in
        love. With that in mind, we automatically include a list of top posts at
        the end so people who discover your work on the web flaot on it. The
        goal is to get people onto your mailing list because you’ll then have
        multiple future opportunities to convert them into paying subscribers by
        publishing great free stuff. We suggest publishing at least one free
        post a week.
