          We use cookies on the Websites for Google Analytics (the "Analytics
          Service"). The Analytics Service is a web analytics tool that helps
          website owners understand how visitors engage with their website. The
          Analytics Service customers can view a variety of reports about how
          visitors interact with their website so that they can improve it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like many services, the Analytics Service uses first-party cookies to
          track visitor interactions as in our case, where they are used to
          collect information about how visitors use the Websites. We then use
          the information to compile reports and to help us improve the
          Websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer’s

          time that the current visit occurred, whether the visitor has been to
          the site before and what site referred the visitor to the web page.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Analytics Service collects information anonymously. It reports
          website trends without identifying individual visitors. You can opt
          out of the Analytics Service without affecting how you visit the
          Websites. For more information on opting out of being tracked by

        <ul>
          <li>To our subsidiaries and affiliates.</li>
          <li>
            To contractors, service providers, and other third parties we use to

          </li>
          <li>
            To a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture,
            restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or
            transfer of some or all of Letterpad's assets, whether as a going
            concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar
            proceeding, in which personal information held by Letterpad about
            our Websites’ users is among the assets transferred.
          </li>
          <li>
            To third parties (collectively, the "Third Party Vendors") to
            further the purpose for which you provided such information to us.
            For example, we may share your information our email platform, for
            the purpose of sending emails or with other vendors for the purposes
            of payment processing, delivery of goods, search engine facilities,
            advertising and marketing.
          </li>
          <li>To fulfill the purpose for which you provide it.</li>
          <li>
            For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the
            information.
          </li>
          <li>With your consent.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We may also disclose your personal information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To comply with any court order, law, or legal process, including to
            respond to any government or regulatory request.
          </li>
          <li>
            To enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements, including
            for billing and collection purposes.
          </li>
          <li>
            If we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the
            rights, property, or safety of Letterpad, our customers, or others.
            This includes exchanging information with other companies and
            organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk
            reduction.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Where any of your data is required by a Third Party Vendor, We will
          take all reasonable steps to ensure that your data will be handled
          safely, securely, and in accordance with your rights, Our obligations,
          and the obligations of the third party under the law. We urge you to
          read the privacy practices of all of our Third Party Vendors before
          submitting any information through the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, the Service may allow the capability for individuals or
          entities (“Sponsors”) to sponsor articles (a “Sponsorship”) authored
          by users of the Service (“Creators”) with a monetary payment conducted
          via integration with third-party payment platform, such as Stripe or
          PayPal. Such third-party payment platforms have their own terms of
          service and privacy policies which you as either a Sponsor or a
          Creator will need to accept in order to conduct a Sponsorship, and you
          will need to provide such applicable information to the third-party
          payment platform. Letterpad does not access nor retain any such
          payment information, for Sponsorships.

        <h2>9. Security:</h2>
        <p>
          The security of your information is very important to us. We have
          implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from
          accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and
          disclosure. However, due to the inherent open nature of the Internet,
          we cannot guarantee that your information will be completely free from
          unauthorized access by third parties such as hackers and your use of
          our Service demonstrates your assumption of this risk. Only those
          employees who need access to your information in order to perform
          their duties are authorized to have access to your information. For

          Specific steps we take to secure and protect your data include, but
          are not limited to:
        </p>
        <p>
          Encrypting the connection between our website and your computer;{" "}
          <br />
          Ensuring the physical and digital security of the servers holding your
          data;
          <br />
          Controlling the access Our staff and contractors have to the data to
          ensure that only authorised personnel are able to access the data.
          <br />
          Notwithstanding the security measures that We take, it is important to
          remember that the transmission of data via the internet may not be
          completely secure and that you are advised to take suitable
          precautions when transmitting to Us data via the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where
          we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to
          certain parts of the Websites or Service, you are responsible for
          keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your
          password with anyone

          Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not
          completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal
          information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal
          information transmitted to the Websites or Service. Any transmission
          of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible

          described above, or for as long as We have your permission to keep it.
          In any event, We will conduct an annual review to ascertain whether we
          need to keep your data. Your data will be deleted if we no longer need
          it in accordance with the terms of our Data Retention Policy.

          will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your data is treated as
          safely and securely as it would be within the EEA and under the GDPR.
          Such steps may include, but not be limited to, the use of legally

          collection and use, to the extent applicable, shall, when required, be
          done in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act
          ("COPPA") and appropriate consent from the child’s parent or guardian
          will be sought where required by COPPA. When we become aware that
          personally identifiable information from a child under 13 has been
          collected without such child’s parent or guardian’s consent, we will
          use all reasonable efforts to delete such information from our
          database. If you believe your child or minor guardian has provided us
          information without your consent, please contact us at{" "}
