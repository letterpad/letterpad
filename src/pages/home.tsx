              Since this is your first time login, this page will give you a
              quick tour of the features that you will need while publishing
              your first post.
            </p>
            <p>
              Letterpad has a simple concept of page and post. The difference is
              that posts can be grouped together with the help of tags while
              pages are independent. And then you can setup your{" "}
              <Link href="/settings">navigation menu</Link> with just tags and
              pages and this will be visible to your audience.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you have a tag by the name <strong>travel</strong> and you want
              all the posts linked with this tag to be visible in your homepage,
              then you should place this tag as the first item in the navigation
              menu.
            </p>
            <p>
              To create a post <ContainerOutlined />, click on the New button in{" "}
              <Link href="/posts">Posts page</Link>.
            </p>
            <p>
              To create a tag <TagsOutlined />, click on the New button in{" "}
              <Link href="/tags">Tags page</Link>.
            </p>
            <p>
              To create a tag and also link it with the post, you can
              create/edit a post and then inside settings <SettingOutlined />,
              you can enter the tags. New tags will automatically be created and
              linked.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can also look around to see the other features. We will
              publish docs to help you with more helpful information.
