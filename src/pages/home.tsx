              Letterpad has a small footprint in terms of features and thats why
              it is extremely performant. As an independent blogger, it was
              important for us to provide a good expereince to readers and
              writers without any paywall.
            </p>
            <p>
              Letterpad is an open source project, meaning all its code is
